    "### Project steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1) All tweets with a specific keyword (Bitcoin) were collected over the course of 3 days using crontabs to collect the data every 5 minutes. The data was stored on SQLite\n",
    "\n",
    "2) After enough data was collected, each tweet was labelled by a human to determine if a selected tweet was tweeted by a bot or human. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - This can have bias involved, but other people were able to validate some of the labels. \n",
    "    - Label Studio was a big help over excel\n",
    "    \n",
    "3) SpaCy was used for the text classification\n",
    "\n",
    "    - SpaCy comes with a series of default pipelines for NLP (Tokenizer, POS, NER, DEP, etc) The text-cat was overwritten to fit this data sample.\n",
    "    - This text-cat was added to SpaCy's en_core_web_md\n",
    "    - The training data was passed to the model and a simple-CNN was chosen as the pipe architecture"
